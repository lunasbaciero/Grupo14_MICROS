02She was more like a beauty
02queen from a movie scene
01I said, "Don't mind, but
04what do you mean, I am the one
02Who will dance on the
03floor in the round?"
03She said I am the one
02Who will dance on the
05floor in the round
02She told me her name was Billie
02Jean as she caused a scene
02Then every head turned with eyes
04that dreamed of bein' the one
01Who will dance on the
05floor in the round
03People always told me,
02"Be careful of what you do
01Don't go around breakin'
03young girls' hearts" hee-hee
02And mother always told me,
02"Be careful of who you love
01And be careful of what
01you do oh-oh
01'Cause the lie becomes the truth"
01oh-oh, hey-ey
01Billie Jean is not my lover
03She's just a girl who claims
02that I am the one oh, baby
04But the kid is not my son hoo
05She says I am the one oh, baby
03But the kid is not my son
03hee-hee-hee, no-no,
02hee-hee-hee, hoo
02For forty days and for forty
02nights, law was on her side
02But who can stand when she's
01in demand? Her schemes and plans
04'Cause we danced on the
01floor in the round hee
05So take my strong advice
03Just remember to always
01think twice
02Do think twice
01do think twice ah-hoo
02She told my baby we'd danced
01'til three, then she looked at me
02Then showed a photo of a baby
03cryin', his eyes were like mine
03oh, no
01Go and dance on the floor in the
02round, baby ooh, hee-hee-hee
04People always told me, "Be
03careful of what you do
02And don't go around breakin'
01young  girls' hearts" don't
02break no hearts, hee-hee
01But she came and stood right by me
02Just the smell of sweet perfume
02This happened much too soon
02She called me to her room, hey-ey

02claims that I am the one
03But the kid is not my son
